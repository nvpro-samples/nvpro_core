\brief load_VK_EXTENSIONS : Vulkan Extension Loader

The extensions_vk files takes care of loading and providing the symbols of Vulkan C Api extensions.
It is generated by `extensions_vk.py` and generates all extensions found in vk.xml. See script for details.
.

The framework triggers this implicitly in the `nvvk::Context` class, immediately after creating the device.

\code{.cpp}
// loads all known extensions
load_VK_EXTENSIONS(instance, vkGetInstanceProcAddr, device, vkGetDeviceProcAddr);
\endcode

/* Load all avaiable extensions */
void load_VK_EXTENSIONS(VkInstance instance, PFN_vkGetInstanceProcAddr getInstanceProcAddr, VkDevice device, PFN_vkGetDeviceProcAddr getDeviceProcAddr);
