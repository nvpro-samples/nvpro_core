//--- Swapchain ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*--
 * Swapchain: The swapchain is responsible for presenting rendered images to the screen.
 * It consists of multiple images (frames) that are cycled through for rendering and display.
 * The swapchain is created with a surface and optional vSync setting, with the
 * window size determined during its setup.
 * "Frames in flight" refers to the number of images being processed concurrently (e.g., double buffering = 2, triple buffering = 3).
 * vSync enabled (FIFO mode) uses double buffering, while disabling vSync  (MAILBOX mode) uses triple buffering.
 *
 * The "current frame" is the frame currently being processed.
 * The "next image index" points to the swapchain image that will be rendered next, which might differ from the current frame's index.
 * If the window is resized or certain conditions are met, the swapchain needs to be recreated (`needRebuild` flag).
